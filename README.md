# Hackathon-BlockChain: NFT Marketplace using Blockchain Technology

This repository contains a proof-of-concept NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace built on blockchain technology. It allows users to buy and sell unique digital assets, such as digital art and collectibles, securely and transparently.

## Features

- **Blockchain Network**: Many blockchain components such as ledger are built from scratch by using python off-the-shelf libraries.
- **NFT Creation and Trading**: Users can mint their NFTs and list them in the marketplace for trading.
